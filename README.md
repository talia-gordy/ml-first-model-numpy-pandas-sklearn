## Overview
-This is my first machine learning training model built with:

~ NumPy
~ Pandas
~ Scikit-learn
~ Google Colab

##Sources
-This project was created via https://colab.research.google.com/
- Dataset used in this project was taken from my respitory labeled "Downloaded-Datasets" with the file name "spotify_data clean.csv".


## Feautures 
- Data loading and preprocessing with Pandas
- Feauture engineering and transformations with NumPy
- Model training using scikit-learn
- Evaluation metrics to measure performance
- Clear documentation for reproducibility

## Results
Model types: Linear Regression, Random Forest.
Accuracy/Performance:
